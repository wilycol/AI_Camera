# Project Progress Report

## Current Development Status

As of 2026-02-19 14:56:57 UTC, the AI_Camera project has reached the following milestones:

- **Model Selection:** The project is currently using the following models:
  - Model A: MTCNN (Multi-task Cascaded Convolutional Networks) for Face Detection.
  - Model B: FaceNet (Inception ResNet v1) for Face Recognition/Embeddings.

- **Features Implemented:**
  - Feature 1: Description
  - Feature 2: Description

- **Features in Development:**
  - Feature 3: Face Registration (Storing embeddings in MongoDB).
  - Feature 4: Live Recognition Logging (Tracking events in MongoDB).
